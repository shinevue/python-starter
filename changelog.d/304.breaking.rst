The traversal of of MROs when using multiple inheritance was backward:
If you defined a class ``C`` that subclasses ``A`` and ``B`` like ``C(A, B)``, ``attrs`` would have collected the attributes from ``B`` *before* those of ``A``.

This is fixed now however due to its nature, it may require fixes on your side too unfortunately.
