In 20.1.0 we introduced the ``inherited`` attribute on the ``attr.Attribute`` class to differentiate attributes that have been inherited and those that have been defined directly on the class.

It has shown to be problematic to involve that attribute when comparing instances of ``attr.Attribute`` though, because when sub-classing, attributes from base classes are suddenly not equal to themselves in a super class.

Therefore the ``inherited`` attribute will now be ignored when hashing and comparing instances of ``attr.Attribute``.
